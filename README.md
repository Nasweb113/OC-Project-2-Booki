# OC-Project-2-Booki


Second project in the web developer course at OpenClassrooms. The aim is to integrate the mock-up of a holiday planning site called "Booki".

Elements provided by the virtual company.
The mock-up for computer and telephone resolutions is given to us.
All the images on the site are also delivered in sm, md, l & xl formats.
The icons are from Font Awesome
The colours are: blue #0065FC - light blue #DEEBFF - grey #F2F2F2
The font is "Raleway".

Specifications
The integration must be done in HTML5 & CSS3, without any framework (bootstrap for example)
The search field must be an input field, the text of which can be edited. The search functionality does not need to be implemented.
Each accommodation or activity card should be clickable in its entirety. For the time being, the links will be empty.
The filters, although not functional, should change style on hover.
In the menu, the "Accommodation" and "Activities" links are anchors that should lead to the sections of the page.
Even if no mock-up for tablet resolution is provided, the integration must support it.
The images must be of the right size so that they look as good as possible and have as little impact as possible on the page loading time.
The code must use semantic tags and must not contain any errors or warnings to the W3C HTML and CSS validator.
The site must be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox.
HTML and CSS must be separate and the file must be organised.
The code must be versioned with git and must have a remote repo on Github or Gitlab.

Notes on the project
The integration is done on the Visual Studio Code editor with the Live server, Live Sass Compiler plugins. 
Sass is used to organise the css.
